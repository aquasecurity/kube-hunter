# KHV052 - kube-state-metrics exposing the secret content in metrics

## Issue description

An experimental feature was added to the v1.7.0 release that enabled annotations to be exposed as metrics. By default, the kube-state-metrics metrics only expose metadata about Secrets. However, a combination of the default kubectl behavior and this new feature can cause the entire secret content to end up in metric labels thus inadvertently exposing the secret content in metrics.


## Remediation

- Upgrade to the latest release of kube-state-metrics (above v1.7.2)
- Delete all the time series data from Prometheus

```
# This command deletes all of the annotation metrics emitted by kube-state-metrics
curl -X POST -g 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series?match[]={__name__=~"kube_.+_annotations"}'

```

This requires the Admin APIs to be enabled. Start Prometheus with the `--web.enable-admin-api` flag to do so.
Please remember that the delete API only marks the time-series data for deletion. The actual removal happens during the next compaction process. To trigger this, the clean tombstones API can be used:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/v1/admin/tsdb/clean_tombstones 
```
