# KHV005 - Access to Kubernetes API

## Issue description

Kubernetes API was accessed with Pod Service Account or without Authentication (see report message for details).

## Remediation

Secure access to your Kubernetes API.

It is recommended to explicitly specify a Service Account for all of your workloads (`serviceAccountName` in `Pod.Spec`), and manage their permissions according to the least privilege principle.

Consider opting out automatic mounting of SA token using `automountServiceAccountToken: false` on `ServiceAccount` resource or `Pod.spec`.
