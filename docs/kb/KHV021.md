# KHV021 - Certificate Includes Email Address

## Issue description

The Kubernetes API Server advertises a public certificate for TLS. This certificate includes an email address, that may provide additional information for an attacker on your organization, or be abused for further email based attacks. 

## Remediation

Do not include email address in the Kubernetes API server certificate. (You should continue to use certificates to secure the API Server!)
